# Otobleak
Otobleak is a soundpack mainly intended for C:DDA forked from [`Kenan's otopack fork`](https://github.com/Kenan2000/Otopack-Mods-Updates). It's practically the exact same with the only difference being the music; in Kenan's version the songs do transition nicely most of the time but they feel too... uninvolved, UNTIL the synthwave songs come up, like carpenter brut's or dance with the dead, they do make for an amazing atmosphere once you get into some badass fight and are near death but come out alive, however, they're limited and usually (at least in my experience) don't come when they should.

*- So, what to do?*

I've opted in to change the whole music pack into something more representative of the cataclysm's atmosphere; as I interpret it, it's a depressing wasteland so that's the kind of songs I've tried to handpick! They're all the same mood relatively speaking and aren't like when the original otopack songs would erratically switch from cryochamber songs to a synthwave one, and while they are all the same mood for variety I've picked some that mimic the adrenaline rush you'd get when the good synthwave comes up, but with these you get to enjoy it with a side of depression :D!

## Music 
Contains dark ambient songs from amazing artists such as Airshade, Alixe., Antent, Ashess, Kaeshani, Leadwave, Ødyzon, Øneheart, James King, Piedkies, Willix, Hisohkah, Arbour, Fantompower, "my head is empty", Reidenshi, Diedlonely, Ambivert, Hiraeth, lost.empathy, Silecut, Thenian, Inertia, Reality and finally, Xyla! (inside the music directory every song contains the artist name(s) as well, and if instead of the name it has `UNREL`, it means that the song was unreleased and is probably unique to this repository, probably because I ripped it off somewhere)

Also, feel free to make an issue/pull request suggesting songs you think would fit, i'd appreciate it!

## Why a new repository?
If i had forked Kenan's repo every git clone would have been at least 2gb, I seriously couldn't be bothered.

## Installation
**1)** Git clone the repository somewhere on your computer (or press the Code button on github and download the zipfile then unzip it)

**2)** Copy the `Otobleak` folder into `cdda/data/sound` (not your cloned version, put the folder that has `soundpack.txt` in it)

**3)** Launch the game and enable the soundpack in the `settings` of the game

## Updating
- This is only possible if you've used `git clone`, otherwise you'd have to redownload the pack.

To update, just go to where you originally cloned the repository and do a `git fetch`, once the git fetch is done just delete the soundpack from `cdda/data/sound` and copy the soundpack folder there again, and there you go!
